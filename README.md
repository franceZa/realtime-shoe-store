# Real-Time Shoes Store Demo Project
This is a demo project for a real-time shoes store built using Kafka, Databricks, and Spark Streaming. The project showcases how to process real-time customer clickstream data and orders transactions to provide personalized product recommendations and efficient inventory management.

## Architecture Overview
The architecture of the real-time shoes store demo project consists of the following components:

* Clickstream data source: A Kafka data source that generates clickstream data for customer interactions with confluent datagen.

* Orders transaction data source: A Kafka data source that generates transaction data for customer orders.

* Spark Streaming: A real-time data processing framework that ingests and processes the clickstream and orders transaction data.

* Delta Lake: A data lake that stores the processed clickstream and orders transaction data as a batch and stream unified view.

## How It Works
The shoes store demo project works as follows:

* Clickstream data and orders transaction data are generated by Kafka data sources and ingested by Spark Streaming.

* Spark Streaming processes the clickstream and orders transaction data in real-time and writes it to Delta Lake as a stream.

* The Visualization Dashboard reads the processed data from Delta Lake and visualizes the clickstream data, product recommendations.

## Benefits
The real-time shoes store demo project provides the following benefits:

* Real-time processing of customer clickstream data and orders transactions for personalized product recommendations and efficient inventory management.

* Efficient data storage and processing using Delta Lake, which provides unified batch and stream processing with ACID transactions.

* Real-time visualization of customer interactions and sales.

* Scalable and flexible architecture that can be easily adapted to other types of e-commerce stores.

Conclusion
The real-time shoes store demo project demonstrates how to build a real-time e-commerce store using Kafka, Databricks, and Spark Streaming. By processing customer clickstream data and orders transactions in real-time and providing personalized product recommendations and efficient inventory management, the shoes store can improve customer satisfaction and increase sales.
